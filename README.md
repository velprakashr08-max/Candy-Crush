# 🍬 Candy Crush Saga — Built with Love, Code & a Whole Lot of Nostalgia

## 💛 A Story Before We Get to the Game

Let me take you back for a second. Not to a tutorial, not to a changelog — just to a memory.

It was a regular afternoon at home. My siblings and I were crammed onto the same couch, one phone between all of us, passing it around like it was the most precious thing in the world. The game on the screen? **Candy Crush Saga.** Nobody remembers who downloaded it first. It doesn't matter. What matters is that within ten minutes, we were all fighting over whose turn it was, groaning when someone wasted a good move, and cheering out loud when the board cleared in one perfect chain.

That game — that silly, colorful, little candy game — somehow became one of my favorite memories with my siblings. The fights, the laughs, the "no wait, WAIT, don't swap that one" moments. It was never really about the candies. It was about all of us, together, in that living room, unbothered by everything else in the world.

## 😷 Then Came Lockdown

Then 2020 happened. And everything slowed down. The world went quiet in a way none of us were ready for.

But here's the thing about lockdown that nobody really talks about enough — it gave us time. Time to sit together again. Time to go back to the small things that made us happy. Me and my siblings found ourselves reaching for those old games again — the ones we used to play before life got busy and everyone went their separate ways.

Candy Crush made a comeback in our house during that time. And it hit different. It wasn't just a game anymore — it was familiar. It was comfort. It was a reminder that some things don't change, even when everything else does.

## 💻 So I Built It

When I sat down to think about what I wanted to create, there was really only one answer. I wanted to rebuild that feeling. Not just the game mechanics — but the *vibe* of it. The colorful candies, the satisfying pops, the tension of your last three moves, the dopamine hit of a 4-match special candy.

I built this from scratch — every line of HTML, every pixel of CSS, every function in JavaScript — thinking about those afternoons, those lockdown evenings, and every single one of us who has picked up a phone and played this game at least once in their life.

Because let's be honest — **everyone has played Candy Crush at least once.** Your mom has. Your cousin has. That one uncle who claims he doesn't play games? He's on level 47 and he's not happy about the ice blockers.

## ❤️ To Everyone Reading This

This one's for you. Whether you played it with your siblings like I did, whether lockdown brought you back to it, whether you're someone who just casually stumbled into level 200 without even meaning to — **this game is for you.**

I hope when you open it, something in you smiles. I hope it brings back a memory you forgot you had. I hope it reminds you of a person, a place, a lazy Sunday, a crowded couch.

That's why I made it. Not for a grade. Not for a portfolio. For the feeling.

Play it. Share it. And if it brings back even a tiny piece of something good for you — that's everything I could've asked for.

*— Made with love, by me, for all of us* 🍭

## 💬 One Last Thing

If you play this and it makes you smile — even for a second — please share it. Send it to your sibling. Send it to that friend you used to play games with. Send it to your mom (she'll get to level 60 before you do, just accept it).

Games like this have a quiet magic to them. They remind us of people. They remind us of time. They remind us that some of the simplest things leave the deepest marks.

This was built by me, for all of you. I hope it finds you well.
